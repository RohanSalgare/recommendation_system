# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System** using **Cosine Similarity**. The system suggests movies to users based on similar users' preferences (User-Based Filtering) by computing the centered mean for ratings and then finding similar users based on cosine similarity.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is `ratings_small.csv`.
- It contains **user ratings** for different movies.
- The data is structured as follows:
  ```csv
  userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
  1,31,2.5,1260759144
  1,1029,3.0,1260759179
  ```

## 🔍 Collaborative Filtering Method
### **User-Based Filtering**
- Computes the **centered mean** for user ratings.
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between users.
- Finds **5 most similar users** to the target user.
- Recommends **5 movies** highly rated by similar users that the target user hasn't watched.


## 📈 Performance Considerations
✅ Works well for **small datasets**.  
⚠️ **Not scalable** for large datasets.
