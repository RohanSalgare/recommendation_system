# Recommendation system
In the digital age, where vast amounts of data are generated daily, recommendation systems have become essential tools for enhancing user experience across various industries. From e-commerce platforms like Amazon to streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify, these systems analyze user preferences and behaviors to suggest relevant products, movies, music, and more. The primary goal of recommendation systems is to personalize content delivery, thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement.<br>

Filtering techniques form the backbone of recommendation systems, determining how suggestions are generated. These techniques play a crucial role in handling large datasets, predicting user preferences, and mitigating challenges such as information overload. The effectiveness of a recommendation system depends on the choice of filtering method, each of which has its own advantages and limitations.

This report explores three widely used filtering techniques:
1.	**Content-Based Filtering** :  Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback. 

2.	**Collaborative Filtering** : The motivation for collaborative filtering comes from the idea that people often get the best recommendations from someone with tastes similar to themselves. Collaborative filtering encompasses techniques for matching people with similar interests and making recommendations on this basis.

3.	**Hybrid Filtering** : Hybrid filtering technique is a combination of multiple recommendation techniques like, merging collaborative filtering (CF) with content-based filtering (CB) or vice-versa.
